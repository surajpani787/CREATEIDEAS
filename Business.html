  </section>

  <div class="container">
    <h1 style="color: cadetblue; margin-top: 50px;">What Are the Basics Of Business Development?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">In the simplest terms, business development can be summarized as the ideas,
      initiatives, and activities that help
      make a business better. This includes increasing revenues, growth in terms of business expansion, <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/what-difference-between-profitability-and-profit.asp"
        data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing profitability</a> by building strategic partnerships and making strategic
      business decisions.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">“Business Development Executive,” “Manager of Business Development,” and “VP, Business
      Development” are all impressive job titles often heard in business organizations. Sales, strategic initiatives,
      <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">business partnerships</a>, market
      development, business expansion, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-ps.asp"
        data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing</a>—all of these fields are involved in
      business development but are often mixed up and mistakenly viewed as the sole function of business development.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Business development encompasses a wide scope of ideas, activities, and initiatives that a business owner and
        management implement with the goal of making the business better.</li>
      <li>Business development can include many objectives, such as sales growth, business expansion, the formation of
        strategic partnerships, and increased profitability.</li>
      <li>Successful business development impacts every department within a company, including sales, marketing,
        manufacturing, human resources, accounting, finance, product development, and vendor management.</li>
      <li>Business developers should be aware of new market opportunities, possibilities for expansion, competitor
        developments, and the current sources of the company's revenue.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1 style="color: cadetblue;">Understanding the Basics of Business Development</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Business development activities extend across different departments, including <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netsales.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales</a>,
      marketing, project management, product management, and vendor management. Networking, negotiations, partnerships,
      and cost-savings efforts are also involved. All of these different departments and activities are driven by and
      aligned with the business development goals. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">For instance, a business has a product or service which is successful in one region,
      such as the United States. The business development team assesses further expansion potential. After all <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">due diligence</a>, research, and studies, it
      finds that the product or service can be expanded to a new region, such as
      Brazil.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Sales</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Sales personnel focus on a particular market or a particular (set of) client(s), often
      for a targeted <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue</a> number.
      In this case, business development assesses the Brazilian markets and concludes
      that sales worth $1.5 billion can be achieved in three years. With such set goals, the sales department targets
      the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/client-base.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer base</a> in the new market with
      their sales strategies.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Marketing</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing</a>
      involves promotion and advertising aimed towards the successful sale of
      products to end-customers. Marketing plays a complementary role in achieving sales targets. Business development
      initiatives may allocate an estimated marketing budget. Higher budgets allow aggressive marketing strategies like
      <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coldcalling.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">cold calling</a>, personal visits,
      roadshows, and free sample distribution. Lower budgets tend to result in passive
      marketing strategies, such as limited online ads, print ads, social media ads, and billboards.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Strategic Initiatives or Partnerships</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">To enter a new market, will it be worth going solo by clearing all required
      formalities, or will it be more sensible to form a <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategicalliance.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic alliance</a> or partnership with
      local firms already
      operating in the region? Assisted by legal and finance teams, the business development team weighs all of the pros
      and cons of the available options and selects the one that best serves the business.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Project Management/Business Planning</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Does the business expansion require a new facility in the new market, or will all the
      products be <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manufacturing.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">manufactured</a> in
      the base country and then imported into the targeted market? Will the latter option
      require an additional facility in the base country? Such decisions are finalized by the business development team
      based on their cost- and time-related assessments. Then, the<a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">project
        management</a>/implementation team swings into
      action to work towards the desired goal.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Product Management</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Regulatory standards and market requirements vary across countries. A medicine of a
      certain composition may be allowed in India but not in the United Kingdom, for example. Does the new market
      require a customized—or altogether new—version of the product?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">These requirements drive the work of <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product-life-cycle-management.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">product
        management</a> and manufacturing departments,
      as decided by the business strategy. Cost consideration, legal approvals, and regulatory adherence are all
      assessed as a part of a business development plan.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Vendor Management</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Will the new business need external <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vendor.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">vendors</a>? For example, will the shipping
      of a
      product need a dedicated courier service? Will the firm partner with any established retail chain for retail
      sales? What are the costs associated with these engagements? The business development team works through these
      questions. </p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Negotiations, Networking, and Lobbying</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">A few business initiatives may need expertise in <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-skills.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">soft skills</a>. For example, lobbying is
      legal in some locales and may become necessary for penetrating the market. Other soft skills like <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networking.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">networking</a> and
      negotiating may be needed with different third-parties, such as vendors, agencies, government authorities, and
      regulators. All such initiatives are part of business development.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">Cost Savings</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Business development is not just about increasing sales, products, and market reach.
      Strategic decisions are also needed to improve the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp"
        data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">bottom line</a>, which includes <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-cutting.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost-cutting</a> measures. An internal
      assessment revealing high spending on travel, for instance, may lead to travel policy changes, such as hosting
      video conference calls instead of on-site meetings, or opting for less expensive transportation modes. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Management can implement similar cost-saving initiatives by<a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing</a>non-core work,
      such as billing, accounting, financials, technology operations, and customer service. Strategic partnerships
      needed for these initiatives are a part of business development.</p>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">What Should a Business Developer Know?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Since business development involves high-level decision making, the business developer
      should remain informed about the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current state of the business in terms of<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp"
          data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">SWOT analysis</a>(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)</li>
      <li>The current state of the overall industry and growth projections</li>
      <li>Competitor developments</li>
      <li>Primary sources of sales/revenues of current business and dependencies</li>
      <li>The customer profile</li>
      <li>New and unexplored market opportunities</li>
      <li>New domains/products/sectors eligible for business expansion, which may complement the existing business</li>
      <li>The long-term view, especially with regards to the initiatives being proposed</li>
      <li>The cost areas and the possible options for cost-savings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: cadetblue;">The Business Plan</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">The business development scenario discussed above is specific to a <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-plan.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink"
        data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">business expansion plan</a>
      plan, whose impact can be felt by almost every unit of the business. There can be similar business development
      objectives, such as the development of a new business line, new sales channel development, new product
      development, new partnerships in existing/new markets, and even <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">merger and
        acquisition</a> (M&A) decisions.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">For example, in the case of a merger, significant cost savings can be accomplished by
      integrating the common functions of the manufacturing, finance, and legal departments of the two firms. Similarly,
      a business operating from five different offices in a city can be moved to a large central facility, resulting in
      significant <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-cost.asp" data-component="link"
        data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">operating cost</a>
      savings. However, would this lead to employee attrition, if the new location isn't
      convenient for everyone? It's up to the business development team to assess such concerns.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">In essence, business development involves high-level decision-making based on a
      realistic assessment of all potential changes and their impact. Through new ideas and initiatives, it aims to
      improve the overall business prospects, which drive the functioning of the different business units. It is not
      sales; it is not marketing; it is not partnering. Instead, it is the eco-system encompassing the entire business
      and its various divisions, <a
